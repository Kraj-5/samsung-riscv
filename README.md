RISC-V Talent Development Program, powered by Samsung Semiconductor India Research (SSIR) along with VLSI System Design (VSD)

##task -1:
   byte instructions always increment by 4
 ex: 10184, 10188   
##task -2:
     lui- load upper immediate
      riscv64- 64 bit
###task-4:
generally, a Verilog code that represents specifications is called micro-architecture.-(Verilog, blue spec, etc)

The specifications on which tested (c testbench) are called architecture. (raw material: ex:-instructions of risc-v)

pc- program counter
npc- next program counter(stores value of next counter).
